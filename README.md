# Betting App BetPinnacle – Manual QA Project

## Overview
This project documents manual QA testing performed for a mobile betting application (iOS).
The goal was to validate key user journeys and ensure stable functionality, UI consistency, and smooth user experience across registration, authentication, betting, and account management features.

⸻

## Objectives
	•	Verify core frontend functionality through manual end-to-end testing.
	•	Identify and document functional, usability, and UI issues.
	•	Maintain structured documentation for test planning, execution, and reporting.
	•	Collaborate in an Agile/Scrum-style workflow with iterative builds and sprint-based testing cycles.

⸻

## Scope

Frontend testing only — backend logic, payment processing, and real transaction handling were excluded.
Testing was conducted on iPhone 15 Pro (iOS 18.6) using development builds provided by the project developer.

⸻

## Process & Approach
	•	Created a Test Plan defining test objectives, scope, and environment setup.
	•	Designed detailed Test Cases covering positive, negative, and edge scenarios.
	•	Conducted Exploratory Testing sessions to uncover UI/UX inconsistencies.
	•	Logged and tracked defects using Jira, verified fixes in subsequent builds.
	•	Maintained regression suite and reports in TestRail and Excel.
	•	Participated in sprint planning, test execution, and sprint review meetings as part of a Scrum-style Agile process.

## Deliverables
	•	Test Plan
	•	Test Cases
	•	Regression Suite
	•	Exploratory Testing Report
	•	Bug Reports (Jira)


⸻

## Key Findings
	•	Several validation errors and UI alignment issues identified during exploratory sessions.
	•	One critical crash in the document verification flow resolved after fix verification.
	•	Improved error message clarity and user flow logic after QA feedback.
	•	All high and critical defects closed before the release candidate build.

⸻

## Collaboration

This project was completed in collaboration with a startup developer (project collaborator).
I was responsible for the entire QA process — from test planning through execution, reporting, and final verification. The app is currently in pre-release development phase.

⸻

## Outcome
	•	All major user journeys validated.
	•	No open critical issues after retesting.
	•	Established a reusable regression suite and documented QA process for future builds.
